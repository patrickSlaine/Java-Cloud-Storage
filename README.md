This application has followed the Readme Driven Development (RDD) process as defined by [Tom Preston-Werner](https://tom.preston-werner.com/2010/08/23/readme-driven-development.html).

Consequently when reading this documentation for the first time please read it in the pre-defined order to understand the considerations that have taken place.

## ___The RDD Process___

#### 1. [Problem Specification](./docs/pages/problemSpecification.md)
Definition of the Problem the application intends to solve.

#### 2. [Technical Considerations](./docs/pages/technicalConsiderations.md)
Considerations that must be made during the design process.

#### 3. [Design Documentation](./docs/pages/designDocumentation.md)
The System Design documents of the proposed solution.
#### 4. [Requirement Analysis](./docs/pages/requirementAnalysis.md)
A breakdown of the work-items that will be developed in the Agile software development process.

#### 5. [Decision Log](./docs/pages/architectureDesignRecords.md)
An Architectural Decision (AD) is a justified software design choice that addresses a functional or non-functional requirement that is architecturally significant.

An Architecturally Significant Requirement (ASR) is a requirement that has a measurable effect on a software systemâ€™s architecture and quality. An Architectural Decision Record (ADR) captures a single AD and its rationale; the collection of ADRs created and maintained in a project constitute its decision log.
