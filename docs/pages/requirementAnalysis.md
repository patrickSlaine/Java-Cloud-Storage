# ___Requirement Analysis___
After refining the problem specification, an effort was made to define the application requirements.

Requirements analysis or requirements engineering is a process used to determine the needs and expectations of a new product. It involves frequent communication with the stakeholders and end-users of the product to define expectations, resolve conflicts, and document all the key requirements.

The application requirements can be found [here](https://github.com/users/patrickSlaine/projects/5).
